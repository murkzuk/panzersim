Two New Objects for TvT
Here are two new objects for TvT, the first is just a textured cylinder, the second is the toolbox I created in SketchUp, UV'd in Max and exported to Maya 5 for export to the G5 engine (TvT).
The scale is way off for the toolbox, as I have never used Maya 5 before and guessed the scale. Though these are the scripts that will require editing and creating in order to add new content to TvT.
There are at least 3 files needed for every new object. Two are created by the Maya 5 TvT exporter and belong in the
Models
folder. The third belongs in the
Scripts/Buildings
in our case, as they are classed as buildings. The third script will need to be created, or you can modify mine, replace my model name with yours.
The file to edit is the MenuConfig Script found in the
Scripts/Editor
folder. Again you can edit the lines I have added to reflect your model names.
If there is a why now, I have learned a great deal over the last 8+ years and found myself playing TvT for the first time in a long time. I have a few models I created for other engines that are able to import into TvT. So I gave it a go, bounced some ideas of my good friend Slomo and we got it done!

Hi Jeff!
You couldn't create mine model for TvT for creation of minefields, it is desirable with a warning board.
The mine shouldn't give a shadow, because with its transparent texture it will be all the same noticeable. I can write scripts.
These two new models will bring more benefit.

Hi Jeff!
You are still living? I already strongly worry, why you don't answer? I hope that with you everything is all right. I changed a script of Mortar a little, now there is a High trajectory and the mine model for Mortar is necessary and for Nebelwerfer the model of a mine would be by the way.
Respond!

Hi!
There was a miracle and I found Maya 5.0.
In what format it is necessary to keep the created models, or some plug-in is necessary?
Teach please!
Nikolay

I am still alive Dr, just busy with my new project.

Hi Jeff!
Thanks for video, now there is a sense to study the Maya 5.0.
Many thanks!

Hi Jeff!
Maybe I do something not so but I can't find in the materials G5EngineShader1.
Explain please in detail.
Nikolay

Hi Jeff!
Now I downloaded and I established WWII.Battle.Tanks.T-34.Vs.Tiger-FLT.
In it there is a Tools folder, in the Russian version it isn't present.
I copied MayaExp.mll in "C:\Program Files\AliasWavefront\Maya5.0\bin\plug-ins", but G5EngineShader1 didn't appear.
What do I do not so? Teach!
Nikolay

I understood!
I learned how to register plug-ins and to Tutorial it is written nothing about the scripts folder.
Already at heart it became easier, I thought I won't understand to pension.

Well done Nikolay.

Hi Jeff!
Forgive for concern, but I have nobody to ask.
In game there is such thing as Collision Shapes, but how to edit them?
Help please if you know as, otherwise many models aren't present sense to export to game.
Nikolay

Hi Nikolay,
I do not have an answer for you, I would think the collision model would be referenced in one of the scripts, or may be the model has to be physicalized.
Jeff

Hi Jeff!
Thanks for the answer.
Nikolay
