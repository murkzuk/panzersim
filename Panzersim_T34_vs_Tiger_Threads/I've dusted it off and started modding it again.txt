Hi All
Its been a long time I know but I have started modding TvT again int MP space, I am converting all of the Campaign scenarios to Co -Op Multiplay.
I have got one scenario working and Proof of concept tested it with two pc's on a LAN and it seems to work ok you can spawn and respawn ok.
I'll keep you all posted

I now have all of the German SP scenarios displayable in the MP DM Menu Screens, Â I can now move on to sorting the mission scripts to make them DMM mp classes. (this makes the SP scenario a MP scenario)
I have also made a discovery whilst looking around the general coding forums white space and notation in the scripts takes up parsing time when the engine is loading the script. TvT has a significant amount of this in the scripts so I will start to optimise the production scripts by removing them.



I have managed to work out that the mainplayer engine start is what drives the whole AI in the scenarios, setting this to false brings all of the AI to life

Sounds very promising! Always got excited when someone starts to mod TvsT, i still keep playing it every now and then because no new ww2 tank sims seems to be coming in foreseeable future.
