Improving Tree Rendering in TVT Using CBaseForest Script: Balancing Performance and Visual Quality
I’ve been tweaking the CBaseForest script (located in Scripts/Common) to enhance tree rendering in WWII Battle Tanks: T-34 vs. Tiger. While it’s tempting to push the settings for a dense, immersive forest, doing so can significantly drop frame rates. Below is a summary of what I’ve achieved, including the original settings for context, and what worked for me.
Key Changes:
Script Location: Scripts/Common/CBaseForest.script
Goal: Increase tree rendering distance and visual density without severely impacting performance.
Original Settings:
ModelDistance = 15.0
MaxVariableDistance = 650.0
HighDensityFactor = 16.0
These original settings produced decent tree rendering but had trees popping in too close, which felt jarring for larger maps.
Adjusted Settings:
ModelDistance = 15.0 (unchanged): This maintains a reasonable distance for tree rendering, ensuring trees don’t appear too abruptly.
MaxVariableDistance = 950.0 (was 650.0): I increased this to allow trees to render farther away, making the landscape feel more continuous.
HighDensityFactor = 16.0 (unchanged): This controls the density of the trees, and keeping it at 16.0 still offers good performance.
Additional Variables to Explore: There are more variables in the CBaseForest script that may impact tree rendering and overall performance, but I haven’t fully tested their effects yet. These include:
ShiftRange: Controls how the trees shift, possibly influencing the smoothness of their rendering at a distance.
MinVariableDistance / MaxVariableDistanceForBorder: These seem to control how far trees render near map borders. Adjusting these might help balance performance vs. visuals in larger maps.
BurnDelay: This might affect how trees respond to environmental effects like fire or destruction.
Results: With these settings, my FPS now holds steady around 70. If I push the ModelDistance or MaxVariableDistance much higher, the visual density increases, but so does the frame drop. Keeping MaxVariableDistance at 950.0 is the sweet spot for me, offering a good balance between a visually rich forest and smooth gameplay.
For anyone looking to tweak tree rendering, these variables are a great starting point, but be careful—pushing them too far will impact performance.
