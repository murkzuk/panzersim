I'm happy to announce that after more than 10 years since the ZW missions, a brand new single-player mission for T-34 vs Tiger is now working!
It’s a basic test mission, but fully functional:
Custom mission folder
Full objectives and briefing text
New .rsr resource file integration
Mission appears properly in the menu
Radar (enemy markers) disabled for full realism (SetShowRadar(false))
Mission Name: Forward Probe
Mission Description:
"Soviet forces have detected possible enemy activity near a key village 1 kilometer ahead.
A lone T-34 is dispatched to probe the area. Expect resistance: reconnaissance indicates possible anti-tank positions and armored support.
Proceed with caution. Identify, engage, and eliminate the threat if possible."
Important note:
This mission is not available for download at the moment.
It requires:
Adding a new .rsr resource file
Manual editing of the MissionsMenu.script
to appear and function correctly.
This is mainly a proof-of-concept to show that new single-player missions are possible again — even in 2025!
If there’s enough interest, I may create a public-friendly version with easier installation later.
Feel free to ask if you’re curious about modding TvT or working on your own missions!
