No Tree Wall
Hi all,
Today, I created a new mod for T-34 vs Tiger. This mod addresses several visual issues that have been bothering me.
First, it removes the distant tree wall that caused strange artifacting. Additionally, I eliminated the aerial micro-texture view, originally used in Whirlwinds Over Vietnam to simulate distant forests. This texture was not useful for tankers on the ground and also contributed to artifacting.
With these changes, the game now looks much cleaner and more realistic.
Copy into your JSGME MOD folder and enable in JSGME.
