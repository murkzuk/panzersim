.RAW Terrain Editing Is Now Possible
Until now, no clear method existed for editing .raw terrain in T-34 vs Tiger. This guide provides the
first working workflow
, including:
‚Ä¢ How to open hmap.raw in GIMP
‚Ä¢ Choosing correct settings (endianness, resolution, format)
‚Ä¢ Painting terrain height using grayscale values
‚Ä¢ Saving back in 16-bit unsigned raw format the game accepts
This means custom terrain is
finally
possible for mission creators.

A Note on How This Was Made
I‚Äôm not a coder‚Äîbut I love tanks simulations. These guides were only made possible using
Gemini 2.5 AI
, which helped me understand the file structure, decode formats, and build working steps.
AI made this possible‚Äîgenuinely.
If you‚Äôve ever wanted to mod TvT but felt out of your depth, these tools can help you get started.

üß† Based on reverse-engineering Campaign_2\Mission_1 ¬†of the ZeeWolf mod
Ô∏è Created by a curious simmer with AI assistance
No fluff ‚Äî just real steps that work
Feedback welcome ‚Äî and if you use the guides, please share your results!
Cheers,
Jeff
