Hello,
After a long time I want to play the game again. Unfortunately everything only opens until the tank track is executed at the bottom of the screen - then my normal screen appears again. Win 10 /6 bit is installed on an Acer Predator notebook. I would be grateful for any help.
Best greetings
Guenther

Other than the usual Koenigstiger, reinstall, try adding the DLLs that are on this site to the root of TvT and that is all I do.

Try these DLL's from ZeeWolf's gift, see if that helps
Back everything up yada, yada, yada.
