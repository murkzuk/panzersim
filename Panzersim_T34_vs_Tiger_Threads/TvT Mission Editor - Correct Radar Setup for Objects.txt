When placing units in TvT, the radar behavior is critical.
By default, AI can "see" enemies through terrain within a certain detection range (~4km).
If you want
proper stealth, surprise, and realistic behavior
, you must
manually set up the radar properties
.
Here is the correct method:
1.
Right-click on your object (e.g., tank, gun, etc.) and open
Properties
.
2.
Untick the
Default
box to unlock editing.
3.
Right-click in the property area →
Add → String
and call it
BehRadarMask
.
4.
Inside
BehRadarMask
, add
three strings
:
"ENEMY"
"MainMesh"
"INVISIBLE_ON_RADAR"
Example from Jeff's mission:
Code:
Affiliation: ENEMY
BehRadarMask: [Array 1]
[0]: ENEMY
[1]: MainMesh
[2]: INVISIBLE_ON_RADAR
What this does:
Marks the object as an ENEMY.
Links radar visibility to the object's main 3D mesh.
Makes the object invisible on radar until you manually trigger it.
Why use it?
- Create
surprise ambushes
.
- Force players to
scout visually
, not rely on radar.
-
Hide objectives
until mission phases progress.
- Make enemy units behave
realistically
— not godlike radar spotting!
Summary:
This method gives you full control over when and how radar is used in your missions.
If you want TvT missions that feel serious and tactical — you MUST set this up!
This can also be done on the .script files but I am no coder.
