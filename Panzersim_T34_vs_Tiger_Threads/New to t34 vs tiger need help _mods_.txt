Can anyone help have the t34 vs tiger demo and the game CD but I can't run that can I put mods in the demo

I think you need the whole game and not the Demo to get mods working =)



I have the game but won't run keeps saying MSVCP71.dll is missing

Aha. its easy, just google for those .dll. they are free downloads from microsoft!
Check this thread on some other forum: http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=156465
