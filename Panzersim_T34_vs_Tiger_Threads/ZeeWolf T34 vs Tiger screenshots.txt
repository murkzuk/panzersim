NSU has given permission for use of his grasses in the ZeeWolf mod. The tall grass texture is very nice
What do you think?

Hi Jeff,
I'm new in this forum and have a question:
Is there any chance to get Zeewolf's single Player mod ?
Background: from 2010 until end of 2015 I made a yearly subscription for US$ 50 / year for Zeewolf's Mod
I saved the files elsewhere but only found the Mod Updates until end of 2012, the files from 2013 on I can' t find any more
My Hope is that anyone in this forum can help me to get the missing files, so I can update to latest version available
Some months ago I tried to contact Zeewolf by old email address, but never got a reply, so I fest that he isn' t still alive.....
Best regards
Michael

Which updates do you have Michael, I had the same, a hdd crash and lost all the early patches but luckily had the last big one
perhaps we can trade
