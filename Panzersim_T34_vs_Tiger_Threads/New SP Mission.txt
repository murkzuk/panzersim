Hi,
I would love to hear how to add a new level SP mission (7) ?
I cannot find any script to deal with it.
Thanks in advance for a tip.

It is very difficult to add new missions, I think only Zeewolf has managed to do this. The missions are hard coded. I did manage to replace the German mission 1 with a new one (on the South Russia map), but am still struggling to get all the units to perform their tasks. I hope some day to create a new set of missions, replacing the default ones with a new cmpaign of 7 misions, but it is difficult and very time consuming.. Real Life (read: my wife
) does not permit me to spend too much time on this, and the fact that IL2 Sturmovik just went 3d also does not help.

I have notice the Editor Manual has been updated.
Nice Work!
Now I would like to know how to play the
Mission1
explained in Tutorial?

hi i have been playing TVT for years now i also downloaded some of zeewolf missions but it made my game unplayable
i love to see SP missions posted on this forum i will try to do some myself.

I know now how to add SP missions. ('
')
I have already made some, and I will post the whole Expansion missions here.

YES !!!
I will include the PDF guide how to do it, is quite simple.
The only think that takes time, and could be hard is missions itself.



Who except ZeeWolf created SP missions? Share experience.
