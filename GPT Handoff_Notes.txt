PanzerSim Hand-off Summary for T-34 vs Tiger ww2 battletanks by g5 GPT Support

üîó Project Hub:
https://murkzuk.github.io/panzersim/

üë§ Modder:
Jeff (PanzerSim, murkz, murkzuk, mudcog) ‚Äì Long-time modder and technical researcher on T-34 vs Tiger (TvT), with cross-referencing work from Whirlwinds over Vietnam (WoV). Heavy reliance on AI assistance for scripting as is a NON coder, mission logic, and game file structures.

üéØ Project Goal:
- Deep modding of TvT
- Terrain, visuals, and foliage improvements
- Functional AI scripting (e.g., wingman behavior)
- Enhanced mission logic, briefings, and audio immersion
- Borrowing visual and logical systems from WoV

üì¶ Key Resources:
- GitHub: Hosts mission templates, CLI tool, and working examples
- Shared documents:
  - WoV_vs_TvT_detailed_analysis.txt
  - WoV_radio_chatter_notes.txt
  - WoV_to_TvT_possible_uses.txt
  - TvT_GitHub_Suggestions.txt
- Python: tvt_mission_builder_cli.py (automates basic mission file scaffolding)

üìò Known Issues:
- AITaskFollow function does not work reliably or as documented
- AI unit grouping through the editor is inconsistent or broken
- Custom missions often fail to load with unclear errors
- User is extremely frustrated due to many failed past attempts

üß† Key Context:
- Jeff has spent over a year on this
- Repeated attempts using scripting advice have failed
- He has mapped out WoV structures to try to enhance TvT
- Past AI responses that "should have worked" caused disillusionment

‚úÖ Best Practice for a New GPT Session:
- Read all included documentation in the repo and .txt files
- Do NOT repeat already failed fixes (e.g., broken group syntax or AITaskFollow variants)
- Offer working examples and exact scripts if possible
- Confirm scripts by using the CLI tool or verified test mission logic
- Respect user frustration ‚Äì avoid false positives

Purpose of this handoff is to continue work *without loss of context*.

Recent Chat Summary (2025-05-02)

Topic: Debugging and refining the tvt_web and mission_builder tools for T-34 vs Tiger.

Core Issues Identified:

Strings class naming mismatches (e.g., missing C prefix in Mission_Strings).

Syntax errors in generated Mission.script files (trailing commas causing parse failures).

Black tank map loading and missing terrain due to incomplete file scaffolding.

New mission not appearing in in-game and editor menus (missing or incorrect array patches in MissionsMenu.script and MenuConfig.script).

Progress Made: CLI-based mission generation works end-to-end; web UI generator partially scaffolds missions but still needs briefing/objectives integration and menu patch fixes.

Next Steps:

Refactor web UI logic to ensure full folder copy and accurate file renaming.

Correct automated generation of Mission_Strings.script with proper class names and escape sequences.

Verify MissionsMenu.script and MenuConfig.script patching logic to include new missions reliably.

Implement thorough end-to-end testing (CLI and web) before user validation.

User Feedback:

High frustration noted; prioritize stability and clear success indicators.

User is not a coder and relies entirely on the tool‚Äôs reliability.

Topic: Phase 1 & 2 CLI Mission Builder Refinement

üîß Core Work:
- Expanded `tvt_mission_builder_cli.py` to support:
  - Arbitrary source missions (`-s`), new mission names (`-n`), and install roots (`-i`).
  - File-type filtering (`-e .script .rsr .tex .raw .bmp .scc`) during rename.
  - Metadata flags in Phase 2: `--title`, `--brief`, `--obj` (multiple), and `--campaign`.
  - Automatic backups (`.bak`) of both `MissionsMenu.script` and `MenuConfig.script`.
  - Menu patching into the correct USSR or Germany lists.

üêû Key Issues Identified:
- Format specifier bug in RSR generation (`ValueError: Invalid format specifier '02d '`).
- Trailing-comma syntax errors in menu array inserts.
- Misalignment between class names, RSR sections, and `_Strings` scripts.
- User confusion over single-line invocation on Windows (escaping and quoting).

‚úÖ Progress Made:
- Phase 1 (scaffold & rename) works end-to-end: clone, rename, RSR scaffold.
- Phase 2 (metadata & menu patch) partially implemented; Phase 2 CLI prototype exists.
- Established reliable single-line examples for CMD/PowerShell.
- Documented required mission files beyond `.script` (.rsr, .tex, .raw, .bmp, .scc).

üöÄ Next Steps:
- Fix format-specifier bug in RSR writer (`Objective{index:02d}`).
- Harden argparse to accept and parse `--title`, `--brief`, `--obj`, `--campaign`, and `-y`.
- Add validation and clearer error messages for Windows quoting rules.
- Complete Phase 2 menu-patch logic and test in both game and editor contexts.
- Provide copy-and-paste ready examples and cleanup of legacy commands.

üë§ User Feedback:
- Strong preference for a single-line, no-fence Python script invocation.
- Need for ‚Äúnoob-friendly‚Äù guidance and confirmation of success.
- Ongoing frustration with mission-naming conventions and menu array syntax.
