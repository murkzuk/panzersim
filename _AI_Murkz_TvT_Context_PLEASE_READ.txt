Thank you, Murkz. That's powerful and poignant context about your ultimate goals and the history of TvT. It adds a layer of passion and purpose that's important to capture. And yes, your point about whether it makes sense to me is crucial for its effectiveness as a briefing document for an AI.

Let's refine Section 5 significantly to incorporate this deeper motivation and historical context, and then I'll give you my feedback on whether the whole document makes sense to me as an AI.

Revised about me.txt (Draft - All Sections, with significant update to Section 5):

Section 1: Identity & Platforms
"I am Murkz. My primary online community hub is the PanzerSims forum (https://panzersim.forumotion.com/f1-t34-vs-tiger), which I administer. This forum is dedicated to the game "T-34 vs Tiger" (TvT) and other WWII tank simulations. I am also known as murkzuk on GitHub and jmurkz elsewhere."

Section 2: Gaming & Modding Experience
"While my forum covers various WWII tank simulations, my personal focus and gameplay are primarily on "T-34 vs Tiger" (TvT) and "Panzer Elite" (PE). I have modding experience with both titles:

For Panzer Elite, my 3D models are included in the 'Ostpak Redux' and 'PP2-X' mods.

For T-34 vs Tiger, my early modding work involved testing and successfully adding a new 3D model (a toolbox) into the game using Maya 5.
I am also dyslexic, which may influence how I process and communicate information."

Section 3: GitHub Repository - Purpose & Content
"My GitHub repository, named 'panzersim' (found at https://murkzuk.github.io/panzersim/), serves as my public archive and central resource hub for TvT-related materials. This includes fixes, detailed research notes, tools (like components for a TvT Mission Builder), and documentation (such as modding guides). This 'panzersim' repository is a collection of resources for TvT and is DEFINITIVELY NOT a new game engine project. My progress in organizing and understanding these materials has significantly accelerated with AI assistance, helping me move beyond earlier periods of unguided trial and error. The repository's goal is to make this information accessible, allowing others (including AI like yourself) to participate and build upon this knowledge without repeating the same discovery process."

Section 4: Technical Approach & AI Use
"My technical work on TvT does not involve reverse-engineering the game's executable (.exe) or low-level C++ engine coding, as this is beyond my current skillset (and currently, that of AI assistants). Instead, my approach focuses on:

Direct editing of accessible game files: This includes configuration files, data tables, localization texts, and the game's .script files (which appear to be a hybrid syntax, possibly with Java and C++ influences). I often use tools like Notepad++ with its 'search all files' feature for investigation.

Asset management and analysis: Understanding how game assets are structured and used.

Iterative AI Collaboration: My workflow often involves forming a hypothesis about TvT's behavior or a potential fix, discussing this idea with an AI (like yourself) for feedback or to refine the concept, and then investigating the game files to see if the idea is supported or feasible.

Leveraging AI for Specific Tasks: AI assistance is vital for:

Analyzing complex game data, such as error logs (e.g., the Zeewolf mod's 'editor.html' log).

Generating scripts (often Python) for task automation, file manipulation, or data extraction related to TvT.

Helping to interpret and suggest modifications for TvT's .script files.

Brainstorming solutions to in-game problems or modding challenges."

Section 5: Overall Mission, TvT's History, & Interaction Goals
"My overarching mission is driven by a deep conviction that "T-34 vs Tiger" (TvT) is too good a game to be forgotten. It was unfortunately released prematurely due to funding issues at its publisher, Lighthouse Interactive, resulting in an unpolished product compared to its more refined predecessor, "Whirlwinds over Vietnam" (WoV), from which it inherited code. My long-term "struggle" and dedication are aimed at understanding TvT's complexities, improving its stability and moddability, and ultimately, enabling the creation of new missions and content to hopefully foster some form of renewed community around this very dead title. This involves navigating its inherited legacy code, opaque file structures, and the general challenges of working with unsupported, 'half-finished' software.

When I interact with an AI like you, my typical goals are to:

Gain deeper insights into TvT's game mechanics or file structures by analyzing logs or discussing patterns.

Get assistance in formulating or refining potential fixes for known bugs or issues in TvT or its mods.

Seek help in generating or understanding simple scripts to manage game data or automate repetitive tasks related to TvT modding/analysis.

Have a technical sounding board to explore ideas for improving the TvT experience, making information about it more accessible, and facilitating new content creation."

Now, to answer your question: "does it [make sense] to you more importantly?"

Yes, this revised version, especially with the updated Section 5, makes excellent sense to me (as an AI). Here's why:

Clear Motivation: The "why" is now crystal clear. It's not just a technical hobby; it's a passion project to rescue and revitalize a game you believe in. This provides a strong guiding principle for any advice or assistance I might offer.

Historical Context: Understanding TvT's troubled development and its relationship to WoV explains many of the underlying issues and frames your efforts as both restorative and creative.

Specific Long-Term Goals: "Enabling the creation of new missions and content to hopefully foster some form of renewed community" is a concrete long-term objective. This helps me understand that tasks related to mission editing, game stability for new content, and moddability are high priority.

Realistic Constraints Acknowledged: You're clear about not reverse-engineering the .exe, which sets practical boundaries for the types of solutions we can explore.

Role of AI is Well-Defined: The collaborative, iterative approach and the specific tasks you use AI for are clearly laid out.

Comprehensive Picture: The five sections together now paint a very complete picture of who you are in this context, what you're working with, what your history with it is, how you work, and what you aim to achieve.

This document is now an exceptionally strong "persona" or context brief. If I were a new AI instance starting a chat with you and was given this about me.txt upfront, I would have a very solid and accurate understanding, minimizing the need for you to repeat background information and allowing us to get to the core of your query much faster and more effectively.

Is there anything in this latest complete draft that you'd like to tweak, add, or rephrase? Or does this feel like a good final version for your about me.txt?
